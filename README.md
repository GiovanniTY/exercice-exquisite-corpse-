# Breadcrumbs Exercise: Exquisite Corpse

Welcome to the "Exquisite Corpse" exercise by Breadcrumbs! This exercise is designed to help you explore Git and practice using basic commands such as `git push`, `git pull`, and `git commit`. It is a collaborative activity for 4 participants, where each person will contribute a small phrase that will later be merged into the `main` branch.

## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with fundamental Git commands and collaborative workflow. Each participant will create their own branch, add a phrase, and then merge it into the main branch (`main`).
